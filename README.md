# InSheepsClothingShowcase
This is the In Sheeps Clothing code showcase repository.
I made this repository to be able to show off some of the coding we did for the project without having to share
the whole project.

## In Sheeps clothing
The political party for animal rights has become one of the biggest and most influential political parties. They have arranged a meeting about their plans for the future. Your job is to infiltrate their headquarters, attend this meeting and gather intel. You'll be disguised as a sheep to blend in with the rest. Do not do anything suspicious and do everything the other sheep do! If they vote, pick the answer that the majority voted for. We cannot trust these animals, so take pictures of anything that might seem suspicious! Who knows what they'll do if they find out that you're spying on them? The fate of the entire human race rests with you. Good luck.

In Sheep's Clothing is a VR Arcade game the player needs to perform certain actions to blend in with the rest of the sheep. Failing to do certain actions results in suspicion from the sheep, which if too much, eventually results in a game over.
